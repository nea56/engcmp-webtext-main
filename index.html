<!-- Field of Study Section -->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am a third-year computer science student at Pitt. Initially, I intended to major in psychology but realized it was more of a hobby than a passion. My father is a computer science professor, and my whole family has dabbled in the field in some way. I had a lot of guidance when making the decision to switch. I hope to work as a software engineer and/or in project management down the line.</h3>

<!-- Knowledge, Tools, and Skills Section -->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
  <h3>I consider myself a thinker and a maker. With my background in computer science and digital narrative, I enjoy exploring how technology and storytelling intersect. My medium tends to be digital design, where I can experiment with user interfaces and interactive narratives. In this class, I’m excited to learn more about blending written narratives with visual elements, and I hope to develop skills in graphic design and creative writing.</h3>

<!-- In the Future Section -->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>In the Future</h2>
  <h3>After school, I hope to pursue a career in project management, particularly in the tech industry. I have always found myself in leadership roles, whether in academic settings or during my internship with UPMC, where I was appointed team lead. My computer science degree aligns perfectly with this path, as it gives me the technical background to manage software projects. Growing up in a family deeply rooted in the field of computer science, I have always been drawn to the world of tech. The work we do in this course will help me better articulate ideas and strategies to diverse teams and groups.</h3>

<!-- What is Good Design Section -->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is Good Design?</h2>
  <h3>A good digital design should be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. It needs to effectively communicate the intended message while being easy to navigate and use. Simplicity is key—users should intuitively understand how to interact with the design without feeling overwhelmed. Good use of color, typography, and spacing is important to guide the user's attention. Consistency across elements helps build trust, and responsiveness ensures the design works well on different devices.</h3>

    <p class="caption">Cartoon Yourself</p>
    <p>This project was an opportunity for me to creatively express myself through 
      a single-panel comic. Using Adobe Illustrator, I took a photo and transformed it into a cartoon, 
      blending aspects of my real image with a playful, stylized approach. The project allowed me to explore 
      how digital tools like the Pen Tool, Layers, and Color Dropper could be used not just to replicate reality 
      but to represent my personality visually. It gave me the chance to reflect on how I see myself and convey that in a fun, artistic way.</p>

    <p class="caption">UX/UI Design Study</p>
    <p>In this assignment, I conducted a UX study with three participants to gather feedback on logo designs and 
      refine the final version based on their input. The study was guided by Norman’s Three Levels of Processing (Visceral, Behavioral, 
      Reflective) and aimed to understand participants’ first impressions, behavior, and reflections on the design. I created a testing script, 
      interviewed participants via Zoom, and analyzed the feedback to inform potential logo redesigns. The final step involved presenting the 
      UX study to the class through a Google Slides presentation, showcasing the study process, participant insights, and the data-driven final logo design. 
      This project enhanced my skills in user research, design iteration, and creating executive-level presentations.</p>

    <p class="caption">Project 4: Cartoon Noor</p>
    <p>For this assignment, I analyzed an example of good design and broke down how key design principles—like alignment, 
      repetition, balance, proximity, space, and contrast—were used to make it effective. 
      I selected a design that stood out to me, ensuring it was high resolution, and placed it on a page in Adobe InDesign. 
      Then, I added detailed annotations and text explaining how the designer leveraged these principles to create something 
      visually appealing. This project helped me sharpen my skills in layout design, text placement, and understanding design hierarchy,
      while focusing on how to effectively communicate design concepts.</p>

    <p class="caption">Project 5: Magazine Cover</p>
    <p>In this project, I recreated a two-page magazine spread (11x17") by studying and replicating the design from an existing publication. 
      Inspired by Plato’s Allegory of the Cave and Deleuze’s ideas on repetition, the goal was to capture the essence of the original design, 
      not just copy it. Using Adobe InDesign, I played with fonts, color swatches, and layout tools to recreate 
      the look and feel of the spread. It was a fun challenge that helped me improve my typography and design skills.</p>

    <p class="caption">Project 6: Design Resume</p>
    <p>In this assignment, I created a visually striking resume tailored for creative roles. Using Adobe InDesign, 
      I applied design best practices and tools like text box controls, type on a path, and text wrapping to build a 
      unique and personalized resume. The goal was to break away from traditional styles and craft a resume that boldly 
      showcases my creative potential. I explored models of creative resumes for inspiration, while focusing on making my design both 
      functional and eye-catching. This project helped me strengthen my skills in typography, 
      layout design, and strategic use of design principles to communicate my personal brand effectively.</p>
